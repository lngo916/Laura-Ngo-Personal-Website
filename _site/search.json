Within the past year, I have two newly adopted cats, Kai and Soriah, who bring joy to my otherwise boring daily life. I was born in Sacramento, CA. As an only child, I was curious to embark on a new chapter outside of my childhood home, and saw college as an opportunity to venture on my dreams. Now living in LA, I have been exposed to a vibrant and diverse community that has enabled me to enrich my experiences and broaden my perspectives outside of the romanticized Los Angeles I often saw in films and TV shows growing up.\nOn my personal time, I am often exploring the city’s neighborhoods, trying foods from a plethora of cultures, or soaking up the sun at the beautiful parks with my cats. Ulimately, my time in Los Angeles has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride, marked by growth and adventure."
