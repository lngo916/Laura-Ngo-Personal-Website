## Bio 

I am currently a fourth-year Statistics major at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am passionate about the intersection of data analysis and real-world applications. I am will be graduating in June 2024, and expecting to return in the fall as I also begin to pursue a career in Data Analystics, 
where I can leverage my analyticial skills to derive insights and drive impactful change in my community. 

Through this website, I am to showcase my range of experience, including my resume, essays, and academic process.

## Personal Life 

I have lived in Los Angeles, CA throughout my undergraduate studies. Within the past year, I have two newly adopted cats, Kai and Soriah, who bring joy to my otherwise boring daily life. I was born in Sacramento, CA. As an only child, I was curious to embark on a new chapter outside of my childhood home, and saw college as an opportunity to venture on my dreams. Now living in LA, I have been exposed to a vibrant and diverse community that has enabled me to enrich my experiences and broaden my perspectives outside of the romanticized Los Angeles I often saw in films and TV shows growing up.

On my personal time, I am often exploring the city's neighborhoods, trying foods from a plethora of cultures, or soaking up the sun at the beautiful parks with my cats. Ulimately, my time in Los Angeles has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride, marked by growth and adventure.
